# Identify 2-3 changes that can be made to our environment to prevent an ssh brute force attack from the internet.

-A password policy should be created for the use of stronger passwords.
-Using Two-Factor Authentication should be made mandatory.
-Root user should be prevented login via SSH.
-An application server instance should be prevented from logging in via password authentication.
-The number of unsuccessful attempts should be restricted.

# Neither instance should have had access to the secret recipes bucket, in the even that instance API credentials were compromised how could we have prevented access to sensitive data.

-The security policy should be updated so that the instances only have access to the free recipes bucket.
